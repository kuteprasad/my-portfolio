        <p>I will talk about my education afterwards. I have done few-many small-big achievements in life, I will not tell them, (tip : don't ask my Mother (because she will tell !)), I don't like many things, but the list keeps updating... </p>

         <h2>Story</h2>
         <p style="color:maroon;">Once I met a 'her'...
            She was looking 'surprisingly' beautiful..
            Slightly ignoring me, she was in her rhythm... 
            I solely inquired her name... at first she ignored, then within few moments, 'Hesitatingly' she said "Hummbaa..."
            I thought to note it down, what a amazing name...
            She was filled with a 'typical' attitude,...
            I was waiting for her question to ask me my name...
            But she didn't...
            I was a humble man, to move the conversation forward,
            I said, " Sam here...!"
            She noded, I got somewhat disappointed,
            But still, I thought, "today isn't her mood to speak, so, I must take her number to talk later..."
            
            With this clear, simple intention, I asked her for WhatsApp number, 
            She noded again...
            
            I caught her 'attitude'... 
            She may have thought that I'm trying to flirt her...
            But still without disturbing her more, I left the place...
            
            Now, you tell me, was I wrong.?
            Can a 'guy' can't ask a 'cow' 🐄 for her number?
            
            -- Don't think, just laugh and enjoy your life !😁</p>
